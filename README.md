# Modular Scale

This library doesn't create anything new, there are similar (and probably better) packages available. This was a personal project to not only create a Sass library for modular scales, but also to learn some [new Sass syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use) and to also look at testing in Sass using [True](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-true).
